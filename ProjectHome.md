The idea of the system is to create a production schedule of the factory automatically, just by adding:
-Product Specification
-Deadline
-Time of receiving the materials
And the system will automatically create a production plan including the phases, starting from receiving the materials to the delivery of the final product.

There is a logic that the agent is going to follow taking into consideration, the number of the machines available in each phase and what each machine is doing, and how long it takes to change from a product to another product and how long it takes the machine to finish this specified product and so on and so forth. It will schedule all the projects available to make sure that they will be delivered before the deadline.
