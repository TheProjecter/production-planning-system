I am using the following tools and programming languages:
> - Java Programming Language
> - MySQL for database
> - Vaadin (Java Web application Framework)
> - Token Server for Linear Programming

The project tackle a main problem which is scheduling the projects for the company that I am doing the project for.

There are a lot of processes:
1- Printing (Whether the customer needs the envelopes to be printed)
2- Cutting (This is a must process, as the paper takes the shape of an envelope)
3- Folding/Manufacturing (changing the shape of the envelope to a real envelope)

There are a a lot of variables and depending on them the timeline can vary:
- There are a lot of different envelope shapes
- There are different type of glues for closing the envelopes
- The customer can ask to print something on the envelopes.

And it will be explained in the presentation what needs to be maximized or minimized to have a great project planning for such products
